# .Net Core application

Note: the commands below use `dotnet` and this works well on my machine,
but I'm using Linux and I don't think you are. Good luck, have fun :)

## Building and running the main application

```
dotnet build
export DOTNET_ROOT=$HOME/.dotnet
./GildedRose/bin/Debug/net6.0/GildedRose
```

## Running the tests:

```
dotnet test
```
